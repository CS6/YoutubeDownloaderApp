# Youtube Downloader

Android App that provides an easy and convenient way to handle audio downloading from Youtube videos.


## Overview

The App features a floating bubble head that is launched when the Youtube App is opened, and a video is being played.

### Update 
Unfortunately, according to the terms of service of Youtube/Google, downloading videos to the device is illegal and could be faced with a law suite.
Therefor, such App can't make it to Googleplay :(
